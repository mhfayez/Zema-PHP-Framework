### Zema PHP Framework is an experimental Framework; The intention is to keep php code or any templating script away from the view. ###

For the proof of concept I have just put some code together and it's by no means secure or robust. If it proved to be a good idea then in the feauture I will do the following changes.

### TO DO ###
* Use Laravel illuminate database component
* Use artisan
* Use a better Router

By using **Zema PHP Framework** you can create a GUI in your favorite HTML Framework (Zurb Foundation, Bootstrap etc..) and directly use it in a PHP application (CMS, Blog, web-page etc ..). 

If you prefer twig and blade like templates and/or you want to use a PHP Framework for some serious project than you should use Laravel or ... 


## Features
* Simple
* Easy to use any html templates/GUI 
* No need to learn yet another templating language 
* Clean URLs
* CRUD actions
* Uses PDO


### Scaffolding ###

Zema PHP Framework has a basic scaffolding which can generate controllers, models, view-templates and a full application.

For example to create a controller

``` php make.php controller articles ```
